So. Lambda School didn't work out. Lambda is a great institution and I highly recommend it if a bootcamp is what you want to do. It just wasn't for me.

So now what?

I love data science. With a passion. I mean, like, I'm obsessed.

And so the journey to becoming a self-taught data scientist begins.

I'm not starting from scratch. I know some Python. I've studied linaer algebra and statistics. I have a couple of projects under my belt. 

My first project was a data storytelling project. Many years ago, I presented a paper on the International Monetary Fund's policies and their effect on certain struggling  economies. The Medium post can be found [here](https://medium.com/@erica.burdett/the-trouble-with-the-imf-444aab460f8).

My latest project was intended to demonstrate my skills in predictive modeling. Using data from the Human Freedom Index and the World Happiness Report, I attempted to predict a nations happiness rank from their freedom rank.  The Medium article can be found [here](https://medium.com/@erica.burdett/can-we-predict-happiness-from-levels-of-freedom-19dde653d822).

I'll put both projects in separate posts. 

So I love what I do and I'm not going to give up on my dreams of being a working data scientist - possibly as a freelance data journalist.

I only have a 2-year degree. I've been out of the workforce for about 7 years now. And let's face it. I'm a 40-year-old female. 

In orther words, I can't settle for mediocrity. I have to be good - really good.

So where to start? Though it's not directly related to data science, I'm learning a lot about how to learn from [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+mind+for+numbers&qid=1594108663&s=books&sr=1-1). I highly recommend it. 

So here I go. Wish me luck.
